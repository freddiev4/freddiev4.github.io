<p>
Hello! My name is Freddie Vargus and I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.teikametrics.com//">Teikametrics</a>, helping grow an e-commerce optimization platform. In the past, I've worked as a Data Science Engineer at <a href="https://www.indigoag.com">Indigo Ag</a>, building out risk management and pricing APIs for growers, and as an Engineer at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quantopian/">Quantopian</a>, building an algorithmic trading platform.
</p>

<p>
I graduated from Boston University's Computer Science program in 2018, and along the way, I did some <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/crowdguilds/guilds.pdf">crowdsourcing research</a> with Professor Bernstein and the Stanford Crowd Research Collective, was in the  <a href="http://course.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> International Fellowship Program, and led <a href="https://github.com/bualpha">BU Alpha</a>, a Quant Research team within the BU Finance and Investment Club.
</p>

<p>
When I'm not writing code at work, I'm either advising the <a href="https://bufcinvest.com/">BUFIC</a> Quant Research team, trying out a new hobby (currently considering trying my hand at piano and music production), or doing something active when I can.
</p>

<p>
My general interests outside of work are: playing soccer, muay thai, pool, learning about languages, rap & hip-hop music, cooking, video games, sneakers, participating in MOOCs, and learning how to keep my bonsai tree healthy.
